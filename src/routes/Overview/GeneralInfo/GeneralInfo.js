      The
      <Bb>
        &nbsp;International Spring Seminar on Electronics Technology
        (ISSE)&nbsp;
      </Bb>
      is one of the renowned conferences encompassing all topics around
      electronics technology and is attended every year by more than 100 experts
      and young researchers from all over the world.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <Bb>ISSE</Bb> - a series of annual conferences and a network of
      electronics packaging education - <b>was founded in 1977</b> to provide a
      European forum for the exchange of information between senior and junior
      scientists from academic communities and electronic industries from around
      the world on topics related to their experimental and theoretical work in
      the very wide-spread field of electronics and microelectronics technology
      and packaging.
      <br />
      The theme of the upcoming
      <Bb>&nbsp;43rd ISSE</Bb> conference is
      <Bb>
        &nbsp;“Trends in Microelectronics Packaging and Interconnection
        Technology”
      </Bb>
      . Since almost two decades ISSE is technically co-sponsored by IEEE and
      participating scientists can profit from getting their papers published by
      the renowned library IEEE Xplore.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The main objectives of the ISSE are both, providing a forum for knowledge
      and information exchange on electronics technology, and, especially for
      young researchers, to encouraging them in developing their interest and
      engagement in the field of electrical engineering. ISSE provide top
      quality coverage of technological innovation in the field of electronics
      and microelectronics technology and packaging.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <Bb>The ISSE 2020 </Bb>will continue a long tradition of the preceding
      ISSE conference, starting by 1977 (Weissig / Germany) and the last one
      held in Wroclaw by Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Poland,
      2019). <Bb>The ISSE 2020</Bb> will be hosted by the Technical University
      of Kosice, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Department
      of Technologies in Electronics. The organization of
      <Bb>&nbsp;ISSE</Bb> conference is a great honor and opportunity for the
      Technical University of Kosice to present high-level scientific research.
