      European forum for the exchange of information between senior and junior
      scientists from academic communities and electronic industries from around
      the world on topics related to their experimental and theoretical work in
      the very wide-spread field of electronics and microelectronics technology
      and packaging.
      <br />
      The theme of upcoming
      <Bb>&nbsp;43rd ISSE</Bb> conference is
      <Bb>&nbsp;“Trends in Microelectronics Packaging and Interconnections”</Bb>
      .
